# PE Service
This is a replacement for the original PEFile service of AssemblyLine

# Dependencies
This service uses the LIEF library.
It also incorporate the Rich Header compiler information from https://github.com/dishather/richprint/blob/master/comp_id.txt
It also incorporate the ordlookup files from https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile/tree/master/ordlookup
Those last two are statically built-in the module and may need to be updated once in a while.
